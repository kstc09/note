### Chat Log - Network Monitoring Project

#### Session Start: [Timestamp]

#### Summary:
This document serves as a running log of discussions, feedback, and improvements related to the Network Monitoring & Visualization System.

---

#### Initial Review of Project Files:
1. **main.py** - Core GUI for network monitoring.
   - Loads network data.
   - Displays network hierarchy.
   - Implements Ping, Traceroute, and Visualization.
   - Needs better search filtering and error handling.

2. **data_loader.py** - Imports network data from Excel.
   - Processes hierarchy: Company > Site > Location > Subnet > IP.
   - Validates IPs and structures the network.
   - Needs improved error handling for missing data.

3. **ping_traceroute.py** - Runs network checks.
   - Uses subprocess for ping and traceroute.
   - Windows-only (`tracert`), needs Linux support.
   - Needs better parallelization.

4. **interface_manager.py** - Manages network interfaces via SSH.
   - Connects to devices using paramiko.
   - Extracts interface details via regex.
   - Needs SSH failure handling and command configurability.

5. **network_visualization.py** - Creates network graphs.
   - Uses NetworkX & Matplotlib.
   - Visualizes hierarchical structure.
   - Needs better label handling and color coding.

---

#### Next Steps & Improvements:
1. Enhance search functionality to highlight results instead of repopulating.
2. Add better exception handling in all modules.
3. Implement cross-platform support for Traceroute.
4. Improve visualization layout to avoid label overlap.
5. Optimize parallelization in network checks.
