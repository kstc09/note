Network Equipment Location - Project Overview
1. Project Description
The Network Equipment Location project is a GUI-based network monitoring tool that helps users:

Monitor network health (Ping & Traceroute)
Retrieve interface details (SSH)
Load network structure from an Excel file
Visualize network topology using graphs
It is built with Python, leveraging Tkinter, paramiko, subprocess, pandas, and networkx.

2. Project Components
2.1. main.py - Core GUI Application
Loads network data from network_devices.xlsx.
Displays Company → Site → Location → Subnet → Host in a TreeView.
Implements:
Search functionality (currently needs better filtering).
Ping all devices.
Traceroute for selected devices.
Network visualization for selected groups.
Suggestions: ✔️ Improve search filtering (highlight results instead of repopulating the tree).
✔️ Implement a status indicator for ping results.

2.2. data_loader.py - Loading Network Data
Reads network data from Excel (network_devices.xlsx).
Parses network hierarchy into a nested dictionary (sorted_network).
Creates a hostname mapping.
Suggestions: ✔️ Add error handling for missing columns.
✔️ Log skipped entries (e.g., invalid IP addresses).

2.3. ping_traceroute.py - Network Health Check
Ping Devices: Uses subprocess.run() to check if a device is online.
Traceroute: Runs tracert (Windows-only) and updates the tree.
Suggestions: ✔️ Make traceroute cross-platform (traceroute for Linux).
✔️ Parallelize traceroute for speed.
✔️ Handle timeouts & failures gracefully.

2.4. interface_manager.py - Network Interface Details
Uses SSH (paramiko) to connect to a device.
Runs show interfaces status to retrieve:
Interface Name
Status
VLAN
Speed
Displays results in a TreeView.
Suggestions: ✔️ Handle SSH connection failures properly.
✔️ Allow custom commands instead of hardcoding show interfaces status.

2.5. network_visualization.py - Network Graphs
Uses NetworkX & Matplotlib to visualize network hierarchy.
Displays nodes for Companies, Sites, Locations, Subnets, Hosts.
Suggestions: ✔️ Prevent node labels from overlapping.
✔️ Add color coding (Online = Green, Offline = Red).

3. Next Steps
1️⃣ Enhance search filtering (highlight results instead of repopulating the tree).
2️⃣ Improve error handling (SSH, Ping, Excel file parsing).
3️⃣ Make traceroute cross-platform (tracert for Windows, traceroute for Linux).
4️⃣ Improve graph visualization (fix overlapping labels, add colors).
5️⃣ Parallelize network scans (faster ping & traceroute execution).

2. Project Components
2.1. main.py - Core GUI Application
✅ Loads network data from network_devices.xlsx.
✅ Displays Company → Site → Location → Subnet → Host in a TreeView.
✅ Implements:

Search functionality (Currently just repopulates; needs better filtering).
Ping all devices.
Traceroute for selected devices.
✅ Integrated network visualization (Now working correctly!).
Next Steps:

🟡 Improve search filtering (highlight results instead of repopulating the tree).
🔵 Implement a status indicator for ping results.
2.2. data_loader.py - Loading Network Data
✅ Reads network data from Excel (network_devices.xlsx).
✅ Parses network hierarchy into a nested dictionary (sorted_network).
✅ Creates a hostname mapping for devices.

Next Steps:

🟡 Add error handling for missing columns or incorrect data.
🟡 Log skipped entries (invalid IP addresses, missing values).
2.3. ping_traceroute.py - Network Health Check
✅ Ping Devices: Uses subprocess.run() to check if a device is online.
✅ Traceroute: Runs tracert (Windows-only) and updates the tree.

Next Steps:

🔵 Make traceroute cross-platform (tracert for Windows, traceroute for Linux).
🔵 Parallelize traceroute for faster execution.
🟡 Handle timeouts & failures properly.
2.4. interface_manager.py - Network Interface Details

✅ Runs show interfaces status to retrieve:

Interface Name
Status
VLAN
Speed
✅ Displays results in a TreeView.
Next Steps:

🟡 Handle SSH connection failures properly.
🔵 Allow custom commands instead of hardcoding show interfaces status.
2.5. network_visualization.py - Network Graphs
✅ Fully Integrated into main.py – Clicking "Visualize Selected Group" now works.
✅ Color-Coded Nodes:

🔵 Sites
🟢 Locations
🟠 Subnets
🔴 Hosts
✅ Optimized Graph Layout – Prevents node overlap using spring_layout(k=0.3).
✅ Ensures Only Relevant Data is Displayed – Graph now follows the correct hierarchy.
Next Steps:

🔵 Prevent label overlap in dense networks.
🟡 Improve graph interactivity (e.g., zoom, tooltips).
3. Recent Updates (✔️ Completed)
✅ Network Visualization Integrated Successfully into main.py.
✅ Added Color Coding for Graph Nodes.
✅ Fixed Graph Layout to Prevent Overlapping Nodes.
✅ Updated visualize_network() to Accurately Map Network Hierarchy.

4. Next Steps (🔜 Future Improvements)
1️⃣ Enhance search filtering (highlight results instead of repopulating the tree).
2️⃣ Improve error handling (SSH, Ping, Excel file parsing).
3️⃣ Make traceroute cross-platform (tracert for Windows, traceroute for Linux).
4️⃣ Improve graph visualization (fix overlapping labels, add interactivity).
5️⃣ Parallelize network scans (faster ping & traceroute execution).
